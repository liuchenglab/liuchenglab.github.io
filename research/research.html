            Vibroacoustic modeling

            <p><em>Vibroacoustics</em> studies the interaction between sound waves and structural vibrations. Efficient
                modeling of complex vibroacoustic systems is usually challenging. Although commercial FEM and BEM
                software packages are available, they lack the efficiency and flexibility for optimization purposes. To
                solve these challenges, we developed sub-structuring Patch Transfer Function (PTF) approach and
                Iso-geometric modeling method for efficient modeling of vibroacoustic systems. The accuracy and
                efficiency have been demonstrated through representative vibroacoustic systems.</p>

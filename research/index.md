# Vibroacoustic modeling

---

Vibroacoustics studies the interaction between sound waves and structural vibrations. Efficient modeling of complex vibroacoustic systems is usually challenging. Although commercial FEM and BEM software packages are available, they lack the efficiency and flexibility for optimization purposes. To solve these challenges, we developed sub-structuring Patch Transfer Function (PTF) approach and Iso-geometric modeling method for efficient modeling of vibroacoustic systems. The accuracy and efficiency have been demonstrated through representative vibroacoustic systems.

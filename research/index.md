The project focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to detect and classify road damages. The primary goal is to develop an automated system that can identify various types of road defects such as potholes, cracks, and surface wear from images or video footage captured by vehicles or drones. The approach involves training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on annotated datasets to recognize patterns associated with different types of road damage.

By implementing advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning models, the system aims to provide accurate and real-time damage assessment. This can significantly improve maintenance planning and resource allocation, leading to safer and more efficient road infrastructure management.

This project aims to analyze the ultrasonic guided wave monitoring signals of composite structures, and to construct a damage detection model to accurately detect and locate the fatigue damage.

By analyzing the relationship between the axial stiffness of the structure and the power spectral density (PSD) of the guided wave signals, a damage index (DI) model is established to provide prior physical knowledge for the data-driven model. With the physics-based guidance from DI model, as well as the physically-consistent constraint, the model can output damage detection results consistent with the existing physical principles. The guidance from physical perspective introduces physical interpretability into the damage detection model, which ensures the long-term, stable, and reliable service of composite structures.

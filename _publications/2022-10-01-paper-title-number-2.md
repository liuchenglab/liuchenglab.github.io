title: "Road damage detection using UAV images based on multi-level attention mechanism"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-12-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: ' This study uses the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) road damage database and describes a multi-level attention mechanism called Multi-level Attention Block (MLAB) to strengthen the utilization of essential features by the You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLO v3). Adding MLAB between the backbone and feature fusion parts effectively increases the mAP value of the proposed network to 68.75%, while the accuracy of the original network is only 61.09%. The network is able to detect longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, repairs, and potholes with high accuracy, and significantly improves the accuracy of alligator cracks and oblique cracks.'

title: "Fatigue life prognosis of composite structures using a transferable deep reinforcement learning-based approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CS2024
excerpt: 'We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based prognostic method. Our approach integrates Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and Transformer architectures to construct a powerful DRL Policy Network, capable of extracting high-quality features from X-ray records to capture the subtle progression of damage in CFRP structures.'

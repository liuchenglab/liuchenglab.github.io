title: "Physics-guided deep learning for damage detection in CFRP composite structures"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CS2024-1
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a physics-guided deep learning framework to integrate physics into data-driven models. This physics-guided convolutional neural network leverages structural degradation trend and physical consistency by combining the output of the physical model with the observed feature in a hybrid model. This hybrid model uses an additional branch to observe the information of stiffness degradation, which is the input into the physical model to describe the damage growth in structures by establishing a relationship with the power spectral density change in the guided wave signals.

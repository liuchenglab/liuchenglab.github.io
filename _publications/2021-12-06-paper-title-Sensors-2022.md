title: "Road surface defects detection based on imu sensor"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-12-06-paper-title-Sensors-2022
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a fully connected neural network (FCNN) based on the inertial measurement unit (IMU), because of the characteristics of IMU with fewer data but carrying more information. Different signals (acceleration, velocity, and Euler angle) were processed by the data processing method proposed and made into databases with various features.'

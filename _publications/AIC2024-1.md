title: "Network for robust and high-accuracy pavement crack segmentation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/AIC2024-1
excerpt: 'To overcome current limitations, this study proposes a pavement crack segmentation algorithm called MixCrackNet. MixCrackNet leverages deformable convolution, weighted loss functions, an efficient multi-scale attention module, and the Mix Structure to identify pavement cracks. '

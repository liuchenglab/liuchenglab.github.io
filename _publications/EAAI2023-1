title: "Deep transfer learning-based damage detection of composite structures by fusing monitoring data with physical mechanism"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/EAAI2023-1
excerpt: 'This study proposes a deep transfer learning-based model, called MDAAN, for the damage detection of CFRP composite structures. MDAAN learns the physical mechanism of fatigue damage from the simulation data generated by the finite element model, and can then transfer this knowledge to real-world experimental data to detect and locate the fatigue damage.'

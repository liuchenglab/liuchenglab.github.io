        <h2 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 5px;">Research Focus</h2>
        <p>Cheng Liu’s research is focused on Physics-Guided Machine Learning for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), Smart Structures, Cyber-physical Systems/Digital Twin, Robotic Tactile Sensing, and Mechanics of Composite Structures. His recent research includes the fusion of data-driven and physics-based methods for SHM to improve its robustness and explainability, so that SHM can really be widely applied in real-world scenarios and thrive in the era of Industry 4.0.</p>
